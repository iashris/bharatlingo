BharatLingo - a fun way to learn languages via YouTube

The project is pretty simple. There is a GUI editor to create jsons for activities. These are in `public/songs` folder. The json needs to be listed in the `Home.tsx` file.

If you wish to contribute, visit [the editor](https://bharatlingo.com/annotate), download the json and add it to the public folder, and list it in Home.tsx and submit a PR.

This is a bare bones project, so functionality improvements are more than welcome.
